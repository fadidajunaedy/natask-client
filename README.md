### WebSocket Limitation on Vercel

Real-time task status updates were originally implemented using native WebSocket. However, Vercel does not natively support WebSocket connections. To enable real-time features in production, integrating a third-party WebSocket server (e.g., Supabase or Firebase) is necessary.

## Future Improvements

- Implement third-party WebSocket integration for real-time updates.
- Improve dashboard analytics and reporting.
- Enhance UI/UX for better user experience.
